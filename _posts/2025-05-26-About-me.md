Hey, Iâ€™m Valdenir Nonaka. 
Iâ€™m into data, automation, and figuring out how to organize pretty much anything. Whether itâ€™s work, projects, or just my own curiosity. After years of keeping my notes to myself, I finally decided to share what Iâ€™ve been learning. If you're into productivity, knowledge management, and tools like Obsidian, youâ€™ll feel right at home on my YouTube channel.

Like the title says, I'm not a devâ€”just love seeing how far open-source can go and starting to believe that humanity isnâ€™t entirely doomed in the process.
